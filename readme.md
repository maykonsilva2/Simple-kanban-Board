:computer: What was created?

Simple Kanban Board is a system of control and management of the production flow in companies and projects that uses cards created using:

- HTML

- CSS

- Javascript

What we have so far: The drag and drop functionality works. The next step is to create a login area, control session to create, edit, delete cards and implement the database. 
(A funcionalidade de arrstar e soltar funcionando. O próximo passo é criar uma área de login, sessão de controle para criar, editar , excluir cards e implementar o banco de dados.)
